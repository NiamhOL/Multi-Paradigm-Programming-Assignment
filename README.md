## Running the C Shop
In order to run the Shop program a C compiler is required.
  - Install Cygwin, which gives us a Unix-like environment running on Windows.
  - Install a set of Cygwin packages required for building GCC.
  - From within Cygwin, download the GCC source code, build and install it.

 In my case I downloaded Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS from < a hef=https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop>here</a>
 I ran the Shop program by entering the following commands:
     cd /mnt/c                  // As I saved the shop file to the C drive
     cd shop                    // Direct into the shop folder
     gcc -o shop shop.c         
     gcc shop.c  
     ./shop.c   
     ./a.out
